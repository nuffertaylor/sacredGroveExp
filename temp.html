        <span>At about the age of twelve years,</span>
        <span> my mind become seriously impressed </span>
        <span>with regard to the all-important concerns for the welfare of my immortal soul,</span>
        <span> which led me to searching the scriptures -believing,</span>
        <span> as I was taught, </span>
        <span>that they contained the word of God and thus applying myself to them. </span>
        <span>My intimate acquaintance with those of different denominations led me to marvel exceedingly, </span>
        <span>for I discovered that they did not adorn their profession by a holy walk and godly conversation </span>
        <span>agreeable to what I found contained in that sacred depository. This was a grief to my soul.</span>
        <span>Thus, from the age of twelve years to fifteen I pondered many things in my heart </span>
        <span>concerning the situation of the world of mankind, </span>
        <span>the contentions and divisions, the wickedness and abominations, and the darkness which pervaded the minds of mankind. </span>
        <span>My mind became exceedingly distressed, for I became convicted of my sins, </span>
        <span>and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord </span>
        <span>but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith, </span>
        <span>and there was no society or denomination that was built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament. </span>
        <span>I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, </span>
        <span>for I learned in the scriptures that </span>
        <span>God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, </span>
        <span>that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God.</span>
        <span>For I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, </span>
        <span>and also the moon, rolling in their majesty through the heavens, </span>
        <span>and also the stars shining in their courses, </span>
        <span>and the earth also upon which I stood, </span>
        <span>and the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven, and the fish of the waters, </span>
        <span>and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth </span>
        <span>in majesty and in the strength of beauty, </span>
        <span>whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceedingly great and marvelous, </span>
        <span>even in the likeness of him who created them. </span>
        <span>And when I considered upon these things, </span>
        <span>my heart exclaimed, </span>
        <span>"Well hath the wise man said, 'It is a fool that saith in his heart, there is no God.'" </span>
        <span>My heart exclaimed, "All, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power, </span>
        <span>a being who maketh laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds, </span>
        <span>who filleth eternity, who was and is and will be from all eternity to eternity." </span>
        <span>And I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.</span>
        <span>Therefore, I cried unto the Lord for mercy, for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy. </span>
        <span>And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness, </span>
        <span>and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord, </span>
        <span>in the sixteenth year of my age, </span>
        <span>a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonday came down from above and rested upon me. </span>
        <span>I was filled with the spirit of God, and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.</span>
        <span>And he spake unto me, saying, </span>
        <span>"Joseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. </span>
        <span>Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. </span>
        <span>Behold, I am the Lord of glory. </span>
        <span>I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. </span>
        <span>Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, </span>
        <span>and none doeth good, no, not one. </span>
        <span>They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. </span>
        <span>They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. </span>
        <span>And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, </span>
        <span>to visit them according to their ungodliness </span>
        <span>and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. </span>
        <span>Behold and lo, I come quickly, </span>
        <span>as it is written of me, </span>
        <span>in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father."</span>
        <span>My soul was filled with love, </span>
        <span>and for many days I could rejoice with great joy. </span>
        <span>The Lord was with me, </span>
        <span>but I could find none that would believe the heavenly vision. </span>
        <span>Nevertheless, I pondered these things in my heart.</span>
